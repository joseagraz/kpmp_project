you are a linux expert and the best bash shell programmer. Provide well documented code that does the following:
1) sums the total size of files in all the subdirectories, none recursive. 
3)do not count files that have the word "bam" in the file name
4) disregard empty subdirectories
5) calculate a histogram of subdirectories sizes
6) in the image histogram, replace the subdirectory names in the x-axis for a integer starting at 1

input: starting directory
text output 2: minimum size and directory name
text output 4: maximum size  and directory name
image output 5: histogram
